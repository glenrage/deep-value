# Deep Value

## User Interface (UI):

- **Input**: Stock tickers, financial data (revenue, expenses, growth rates, etc.).
- **Output**: DCF model results, AI explanations, sentiment insights, and charts.
- **Technology**: React.js or Vue.js for the front-end, Chart.js/D3.js for visualizations.

## API Gateway:

- **Function**: Acts as the central hub for communication between the front-end, AI services, stock data APIs, and the back-end.
- **Technology**: Node.js/Express or GraphQL for API routing.

## Stock Data API:

- **Function**: Retrieves financial data for the selected stock ticker.
- **Example APIs**: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance.
- **Response**: Company financials, stock price history, key metrics.
- **Technology**: RESTful API integration in the back-end.

## Custom DCF Model Service (AI-Enhanced):

- **Function**: Receives financial input (e.g., revenue, growth rate) and calculates the stock's intrinsic value using a DCF formula enhanced by AI predictions.
- **Process**:
  - Pulls data from the stock data API.
  - **AI Prediction**: AI models predict key inputs like revenue growth, operating margins, and discount rates based on historical performance, industry trends, and macroeconomic data.
  - **Dynamic Scenario Analysis**: Uses AI to run multiple scenario analyses and sensitivity tests (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations) on DCF inputs.
  - **Sentiment-Driven Adjustments**: Integrates sentiment data into the DCF to adjust growth rates and risk based on market perception.
  - Runs the DCF calculation with dynamic inputs.
  - **AI Feedback Loop**: Continuously refines inputs using reinforcement learning models to improve the accuracy of the valuation.
- **Technology**: Python/Node.js microservice for DCF calculations, machine learning models (scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for AI predictions.

## AI Service (ChatGPT API):

- **Function**: Generates explanations and recommendations based on DCF results.
- **Features**:
  - Provides natural language explanations for DCF model results.
  - Generates stock recommendations based on financial trends and AI-analyzed market conditions.
  - Adjusts stock valuation forecasts based on market sentiment or DCF results.
- **Technology**: OpenAIâ€™s GPT API integration.

## Sentiment Analysis Module:

- **Function**: Scrapes news articles, social media, and earnings calls to assess public sentiment around the stock.
- **Integration**: Sentiment data is factored into the DCF model by adjusting growth rates and discount rates based on positive or negative sentiment.
- **Technology**: Python/NLP libraries for sentiment analysis (e.g., Hugging Face), APIs like Twitter, Google News, or web scraping for data collection.

## Embeddings and Vector Database:

- **Function**: Stores and retrieves historical stock data, past market trends, and earnings calls.
- **Embeddings**: Converts textual data (e.g., earnings call transcripts) into vector representations for similarity searches.
- **Vector Database**: Stores these embeddings and enables semantic search to identify similar market patterns or performances.
- **Technology**: Pinecone or FAISS for vector search, Elasticsearch for full-text search.

## Data Storage:

- **Function**: Stores user-generated input (e.g., revenue, expenses, DCF results), stock financials, and AI-generated insights.
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for structured financial data storage, AWS S3 for large datasets (e.g., historical trends).

## Visualization Component:

- **Function**: Visualizes the DCF model's output, AI recommendations, and historical stock performance.
- **Technology**: Front-end libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for creating charts and interactive data visualizations.
